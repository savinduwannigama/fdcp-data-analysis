# Data Analysis for IoT Network Data: Research Supporting Behavioral Transparency of Protocols

This repository contains Python Jupyter Notebook scripts used for data extraction, processing, and analysis in the research paper:  
**[Unveiling Behavioral Transparency of Protocols Communicated by IoT Networked Assets](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=I6kUmVIAAAAJ&citation_for_view=I6kUmVIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC)**

These scripts were developed as part of the study to understand behavioral transparency in IoT network communications and their associated protocols.

## Important Note

The dataset used by these scripts is not included in this repository due to storage limitations, as the files are too large to host here. If you would like to reproduce the analysis, you will need to obtain the necessary data files independently. Please contact the corresponding author of the paper for guidance on accessing the dataset.
